How We Work - Lookahead Search

We help top companies build web and mobile development teams.

Candidates

INTERESTING ROLES
The companies we work with typically create software products rather than client websites. They care about code quality and creating a work environment where technical people thrive.

WE’RE TECHNICAL
Had a recruiter ask if you had 10 years Rails experience and outstanding OO? We promise that wasn’t us.

REAL JOB DESCRIPTIONS
We think our clients are awesome but no company is perfect. We'll tell you what’s great about a job and what's not. You’re going to figure it out anyway, so why not go in prepared?

PART OF THE COMMUNITY
We’re consistently attending industry events because we love getting to know people way before they ever need our help. Say hello if you see us around!

Clients

ONE RESUME, MAYBE TWO
We interview people every day so that you don’t have to. The people we send have been carefully vetted for both technical capability and cultural fit.

FOCUS
We take on a manageable workload and focus on filling every role. If we take on your assignment, it's a top priority.

FOLLOW UP
After the first 1, 3 and 6 months we check in to see how both the client and candidate are going. It’s part of the reason people we place stick around.

ONE CONTACT, MANY RECRUITERS
Have recruiters hounding you? We’ll take exclusive responsibility for placing your role, acting as a filter and single point of contact.

Connecting Them

We look ahead to emerging technologies and long term relationships. We locate the best software engineers and place them in rewarding work environments.

Our connections go deeper than most recruiters. We have grown up with technology, made it our livelihood and worked in technical roles. Then we started recruiting.
